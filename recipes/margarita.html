        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tequila or Reposado</strong> - 1.5 ounces</li>
                <li><strong>Cointreau or Triple Sec</strong> - 1 ounce</li>
                <li><strong>Lime Juice</strong> - 0.75 ounces</li>
                <li><strong>Garnish of Lime</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Ice</strong></li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut a notch in a lime wedge, then run the lime around the rim of a glass. Dip the edge of the rim into a plate of salt</li>
                <li>Place all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with 4 ice cubes and shake until cold</li>
                <li>Strain the margarita into the glass with the salted rim. Fill the glass with ice and serve</li>
            </ol>
            <p><em>*We like the nuanced aged flavor of reposado, but either works</em></p>
