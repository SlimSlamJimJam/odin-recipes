        <h1>Whiskey Sour Recipe</h1>
            <img src="../images/whiskeysour.jpg" alt="Tasty Whiskey Sour Image">
            <p>This is the cocktail that started it all. Here at <em>A Couple Cooks</em>, we’re cocktail obsessed. We have a myriad of cocktail recipes. But the first that got us hooked on great cocktails was this <strong></strong>whiskey sour recipe</strong>! The whiskey sour is a perfectly sweet tart, balanced whiskey drink that actually dates back to the 1870’s. This recipe uses bourbon and maple syrup: and man, is it tasty! It’s become a family favorite recipe — you’ll see it often at our family parties. Here’s the recipe and how it came to be.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bourbon Whiskey:</strong> as high quality as possible (you can use any whiskey, but we prefer the flavor of bourbon) - 2 ounces</li>
                <li><strong>Lemon Juice</strong> - 1 ounce</li>
                <li><strong>Maple Syrup or Simple Syrup</strong> - 0.75 ounces</li>
                <li><strong>Garnish of Orange Peel and Cocktail Cherry</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Ice</strong></li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the bourbon whiskey, lemon juice, and syrup to a cocktail shaker. Fill with a handful of ice and shake until very cold</li>
                <li>Strain the drink into a lowball or Old Fashioned glass. Serve with ice, an orange peel and a cocktail cherry</li>
            </ol>
